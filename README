== Welcome to FreeMIS

FreeMIS is an open source, web based Management Information System for schools.  It
is built with the Ruby on Rails development framework, and uses the MySQL database
by default, but you can plug in any back end database that Rails supports (currently
MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQLServer, SQLite).


== Getting started

This package contains a Rails application.  In order to run this application, you will
need to set up the Ruby on Rails environment on your server, and also have a web server 
and database.  None of this is going to be easy if you are an educator looking to try
out FreeMIS.  If this sounds like you, I thoroughly recommend that you look at the online
demo - you can find it at http://demo.freemis.net.  If you have have already checked out
the demo, and think that FreeMIS might be what you are looking for, then you will need to
organise professional web hosting.  Get in touch with me (email at the bottom) and I can
point you in the direction of a trustworthy company.
